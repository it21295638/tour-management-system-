# tour-management-system-

In year 2, semester 2, as part of the "ITP" module, we successfully developed an online air ticket booking management system. In this project, my specific role was tour management. I was responsible for implementing crucial CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing tour packages.

My code allowed users to efficiently create new tour packages, update existing ones, delete unnecessary packages, and also view the details of various tour options. This contribution significantly enhanced the overall functionality of the system and improved the user experience when dealing with tour-related aspects.

Our teamwork and dedication led to the successful completion of this module, and my focus on tour management greatly contributed to the project's overall success.
